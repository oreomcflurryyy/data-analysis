        "### **Analysis and Insights**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **1. Boosting (MSE: 14.40)**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Best Performance:** Boosting techniques achieved the lowest MSE, indicating the highest accuracy in predicting housing prices.\n",
        "- **Why It Performed Well:**\n",
        "  - **Sequential Learning:** Boosting builds models in sequence, where each new model focuses on correcting errors from previous ones.\n",
        "  - **Complex Pattern Capturing:** Effectively models complex non-linear relationships and interactions between variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **2. Bagging (MSE: 14.98)**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Strong Performance:** Bagging closely follows Boosting with a slightly higher MSE.\n",
        "- **Why It Performed Well:**\n",
        "  - **Variance Reduction:** Bagging reduces variance by training multiple models on different subsets of the data and aggregating their predictions.\n",
        "  - **Robustness to Overfitting:** Helps prevent overfitting compared to individual trees.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **3. Random Forest (MSE: 18.76)**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Good Performance:** Random Forests, an ensemble of decision trees with added randomness, performed well with an MSE under 20.\n",
        "- **Why It Performed Well:**\n",
        "  - **Feature Randomness:** By selecting random subsets of features, it decorrelates trees and enhances generalization.\n",
        "  - **Ensemble Strength:** Combines multiple trees to improve predictive accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **4. Regression Trees (Decision Trees) (MSE: 26.52)**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Moderate Performance:** Standalone regression trees have a higher MSE compared to ensemble methods.\n",
        "- **Why It Performed Moderately:**\n",
        "  - **Overfitting Risk:** Individual trees can overfit the training data if not properly pruned.\n",
        "  - **Lack of Ensemble Benefits:** Without aggregation, they may not generalize well to new data.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **5. Linear Regression (MSE: 28.15)**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Baseline Model:** Serves as a reference point for evaluating other models.\n",
        "- **Why It Performed Less Well:**\n",
        "  - **Linearity Assumption:** May not capture non-linear relationships in the data.\n",
        "  - **Sensitivity to Outliers:** Linear regression can be influenced by extreme values or skewed data.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **6. Ridge Regression (MSE: 28.19)**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Similar to Linear Regression:** Shows very close MSE to standard linear regression.\n",
        "- **Why It Performed Less Well:**\n",
        "  - **L2 Regularization:** Adds penalty to large coefficients to reduce overfitting but may not significantly improve MSE if linearity assumption isn't sufficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **7. Lasso Regression (MSE: 28.21)**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Comparable Performance:** MSE is almost the same as Linear and Ridge Regression.\n",
        "- **Why It Performed Less Well:**\n",
        "  - **L1 Regularization:** Can zero out coefficients of less important features; however, does not substantially improve predictive accuracy in this case.\n",
        "  - **Linearity Limitation:** Still based on a linear model that may not capture complex patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **8. K-Nearest Neighbors (MSE: 28.49)**\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**\n",
        "  - **Boosting:** Adjust learning rate, number of estimators, maximum depth, and regularization parameters.\n",
        "  - **KNN:** Experiment with different values of K and distance metrics.\n",
        "- **Cross-Validation:** Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to ensure model generalization and avoid overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **3. Enhance Data Preprocessing**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Feature Scaling:** Important for models like KNN and algorithms sensitive to the scale of data.\n",
        "- **Feature Engineering:**\n",
